Hi, I'm Pat Mendoza and a recent grad from cornell. I've worked in SQL, R, and Python for several years and am working on uploading some examples of my work. There's nothing I enjoy more than figuring out a way to present data in an aesthetically pleasing and informative presentation. This often involves transforming files in python then integrating them and creating visualizations in R. 

Here are a few examples of my work that I've been able to upload so far:
1. R
	1. [Mirrorplot](https://github.com/patmendoza330/mirrorplot) - this is creating a simple mirrorplot that can be good visualization for showing up/down regulated genes in an RNA-seq.
	2.  [Clustering Samples](https://github.com/patmendoza330/clustering) - clustering is a common exercise to determine how closely samples are related to eachother. This shows how samples can be clustered using a PCoA and PCA and visualizing using ggplot.
	3. [Data Wrangling with tidyr and dplyr](https://github.com/patmendoza330/annotationwrangling) - converting integrating data from multiple sources is often tricky business. Luckily there are some great tools available that make this a breeze.
2. Python
	1. [Converting files in non-tabular to tabular format](https://github.com/patmendoza330/geneontologyconversion) - Oftentimes, we come across data that isn't in the form that we need to make joins, when that happens, we can convert those using simple python scripts
