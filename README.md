Hi, I'm Pat Mendoza, a recent grad from Cornell. I enjoy figuring out ways to integrate and present data in an aesthetically pleasing and informative format. This often involves transforming files in python then integrating them and creating visualizations in R. 

I've worked in SQL, R, and Python for several years and am currently working on uploading some examples of my work. 

Here are a few that I have so far (more upcoming):
1. R
	1. [Mirrorplot](https://github.com/patmendoza330/mirrorplot) - this is creating a simple mirrorplot that can be good visualization for showing up/down regulated genes in an RNA-seq.
	2.  [Clustering Samples](https://github.com/patmendoza330/clustering) - clustering is a common exercise to determine how closely samples are related to eachother. This shows how samples can be clustered using a PCoA and PCA and visualizing using ggplot.
	3. [Data Wrangling with tidyr and dplyr](https://github.com/patmendoza330/annotationwrangling) - converting and integrating data from multiple sources is often tricky business. Luckily there are some great tools available that make this a breeze.
2. Python
	1. [Converting files in non-tabular to tabular format](https://github.com/patmendoza330/geneontologyconversion) - Oftentimes, we come across data that isn't in the form that we need to make joins, when that happens, we can convert those using simple python scripts
3. [Misc Python](https://github.com/patmendoza330/miscrna) (in development) - some misc scripts that I used to add in RNA-seq generation.
